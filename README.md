# Godot Tech Demo

This is a tech demo I put together to familiarize myself with Godot's toolkit.  This demo consists of simple AI for two cows in the scene, a tilemap background with animated tiles and proper layering and collision, normalization of the player's diagonal movement, proper collision between cows and the player, a coin block with proper signaling for collection, camera smoothing, and appropriate rescaling for multiple resolutions.

This is meant to be a simple tech demo, so there is no plan for any additional features, nor are there many features in this demo.
